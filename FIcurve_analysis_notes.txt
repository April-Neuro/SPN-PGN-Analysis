*hyp_pulse*
if yes, this means the protcol delivered a 5pA hyperpolarizing pulse before the depolarizing step. The responding change in voltage is used to quantify IR

*holding potential* 
for each step, calculated as the average from data points 1-1000 (before the hyperpolarizing step). Other values such as threshold voltage depend on this value, therefore a stable baseline is important.  


*step*
The current that was delivered for that row of data.

*f_AHP*
for every spike, the difference between thresholdVoltage (described below) and the minimum value that occurs within 500 data points (50ms) after that peak. The values for all peaks are averaged together so that each current step has one value. 

*input_resistance_step*


*half_width_duration*
this value is measured for every spike, and then those values are averaged together to give one value per step. the way this is measured is to calculate the peak amplitude and the absolute threshold voltage (described below). The distance between these is divided in half to find the half amplitude. For each step, I locate the x values that correspond to this 'target' amplitude. Subtract these x values from one another for each step gives me the width. then i just convert to milliseconds.

*input_resistance_step*
if a particular sweep has a hyperpolarizaing pulse, then I can calculate this. I measure the voltage deflection from the start of the hyp pulse to the end. V=IR, therefore R=V/I. the current is simply the ampiltude of the hyp pulse. this input resistance value is calculated for each step. 


*average peak amplitude*
for each step, all of the spikes for that step are averaged together. simply measured as the absolute value (y value) of the peak. 

*stderror peak amplitude*
for each step, the amplitudes of every spike were averaged together (above), this is simply the standard error of that same measurment. 

*instantaneous freq aps*
This is calculated as the interval between each spike, averaged and converted to Hz. therefore there is one value for each step. it is a more precise measurement of frequency.

*freq_aps*
this is the 'crude' calculation for frequency. simply, the number of action potentials divided by seconds (0.5). 

*sweep*
the sweep number. for each cell, i usually ran a few FI curve protocols. each time is 1 sweep. 

*RMP*
resting membrane potential, calculated during recording

*input_resistance_cell*
for each cell, the input resistance. if there is a hyperpolarizing pulse, then I just average together the input resistance for that step (input_resistance_step, above). otherwise i just use the value calculated during recording.

*rheobase*
calculated as the first current step at which there is a spike (current steps are at intervals of 5pA). measured once for each sweep (meaning each time i run through the entire step protocol) 

*absolute_threshold_voltage*
this value takes the rheobase for that sweep, and using the calculated input resistance(input_resistance_step, above), converts that value to the relative threshold voltage. holding_potential + relative_threshold = absolute_threshold_voltage
